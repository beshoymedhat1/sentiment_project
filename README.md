# Sentiment Analysis Project
## Overview
This project aims to classify text data into three sentiment categories: Positive, Negative, and Neutral. 
The project uses various machine learning and deep learning techniques, with the best results achieved using an LSTM model with Word2Vec embeddings.

## Features
*   Multiple Models: Implementation of multiple models, including SimpleRNN, GRU, LSTM, and RandomForestClassifier.
*   Word Embeddings: Use of Word2Vec for creating word embeddings.
*   TF-IDF with Random Forest: A traditional approach using TF-IDF vectors and RandomForestClassifier.
*   Best Accuracy: The LSTM model achieved the highest accuracy.
